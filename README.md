# Stats-week
Statistics journal club

Here's a list of lectures I've led for the Wiser Stats-Study group. The lectures are as follows:
- [Cross_validation](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Cross_validation.ipynb): Using scikit-learn for different Cross-Validation techniques.
- [Jackknife_and_Bootstrap](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Jackknife_and_Bootstrap.ipynb): The Jackknife, the Bootstrap, Poisson Bootstrap, and Moving-Block Bootstrap.
- [Generalized_Linear_Models](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Generalized_Linear_Models.ipynb): GLMs, the Exponential family of distributions, MLE, and McFadden's R^2.
- [Point_estimation](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Point_estimation.ipynb): Some technical terms for statistical estimators (efficency, robustness, etc.) and the Cramer-Rao-Frechet inequality.
- [Grubbs_and_Qtest](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Grubbs_and_Qtest.ipynb): Outlier detection techniques for univariate data. Z-scores, Hodge-Lehmann estimator, IQR, MAD, Rousseeuw and Croux' Q and S, and Tarr's P. Oh, and the Dixon's Q test and Grubb's test (you can see how the focus changed as I was working on this...)
- [Fourier](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Fourier.ipynb): Introduction to Fourier analysis. Fourier series, Fourier transform, the Discrete Fourier Transform and FFT, Welch's method, and Shannon-Nyquist and resolution.
- [Savitsky_Golay_Filters](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Savitsky_Golay_Filters.ipynb): Savitsky-Golay filters for periodic data. General properties and their behavior as a low-pass filter.
- [Hilbert_Transform](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Hilbert_Transform.ipynb): The Hilbert and Hilbert-Huang transforms. Application to financial data. Work in progress.
- [Bayesian_blocks](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Bayesian_blocks.ipynb): Knuth's rule and Bayesian Blocks for histograms/time-series data. Work in progress.
