# Stats-week
Statistics journal club

Here's a list of lectures I've led for the Wiser Stats-Study group. The lectures are as follows:
- Cross_validation: Using scikit-learn for different Cross-Validation techniques.
- Jackknife_and_Bootstrap: The Jackknife, the Bootstrap, Poisson Bootstrap, and Moving-Block Bootstrap.
- Generalized_Linear_Models: GLMs, the Exponential family of distributions, MLE, and McFadden's R^2.
- Point_estimation: Some technical terms for statistical estimators (efficency, robustness, etc.) and the Cramer-Rao-Frechet inequality.
- Grubbs_and_Qtest: Outlier detection techniques for univariate data. Z-scores, Hodge-Lehmann estimator, IQR, MAD, Rousseeuw and Croux' Q and S, and Tarr's P. Oh, and the Dixon's Q test and Grubb's test (you can see how the focus changed as I was working on this...)
- Fourier: Introduction to Fourier analysis. Fourier series, Fourier transform, the Discrete Fourier Transform and FFT, Shannon-Nyquist and resolution. Work in progress.
- Bayesian_blocks: Knuth's rule and Bayesian blocks for histograms/time-series data. Work in progress.
