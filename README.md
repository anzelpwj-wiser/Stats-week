# Stats-week

I led a statistics study group for a few months during my time at Wiser. My notes for the lectures I gave are below.

(N.B. GitHub has stopped rendering MathJax properly over the past few months, and it doesn't seem to be getting addressed anytime soon. I recommend reading these notebooks [over at NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anzelpwj/Stats-week/tree/master/).)

- [Cross_validation](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Cross_validation.ipynb): Using scikit-learn for different Cross-Validation techniques.
- [Jackknife_and_Bootstrap](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Jackknife_and_Bootstrap.ipynb): The Jackknife, the Bootstrap, Poisson Bootstrap, and Moving-Block Bootstrap.
- [Generalized_Linear_Models](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Generalized_Linear_Models.ipynb): GLMs, the Exponential family of distributions, MLE, and McFadden's R^2.
- [Point_estimation](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Point_estimation.ipynb): Some technical terms for statistical estimators (efficency, robustness, etc.) and the Cramer-Rao-Frechet inequality.
- [Grubbs_and_Qtest](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Grubbs_and_Qtest.ipynb): Outlier detection techniques for univariate data. Z-scores, Hodge-Lehmann estimator, IQR, MAD, Rousseeuw and Croux' Q and S, and Tarr's P. Oh, and the Dixon's Q test and Grubb's test (you can see how the focus changed as I was working on this...)
- [Fourier](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Fourier.ipynb): Introduction to Fourier analysis. Fourier series, Fourier transform, the Discrete Fourier Transform and FFT, Welch's method, and Shannon-Nyquist and resolution.
- [Savitsky_Golay_Filters](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Savitsky_Golay_Filters.ipynb): Savitsky-Golay filters for periodic data. General properties and their behavior as a low-pass filter.
- [Hilbert_Transform](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Hilbert_Transform.ipynb): The Hilbert and Hilbert-Huang transforms.
- [HOT SAX](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/HOT_SAX.ipynb): Keogh, et al.'s O(m) method for discord discovery in time series using Symbolic Aggregate approXimation. Probably the best acronym.
- [Bayesian_blocks](https://github.com/anzelpwj/Stats-week/blob/master/Bayesian_blocks.ipynb): Knuth's rule and Bayesian Blocks for histograms/time-series data. Knuth's Rule notes are done, Bayesian Blocks has not been written - 50% done.
